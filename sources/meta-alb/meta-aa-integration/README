Yocto layer for integrating Adaptive Autosar R20-11 in NXP Auto Linux BSP
=========================================================================

Adaptive Autosar R20-11 Platform Demonstrator
---------------------------------------------

The AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AP) is the standardized platform for microprocessor-based ECUs
supporting use cases like highly automated and autonomous driving as well as high speed on-board
and off-board communication.

Yocto integration layer within Linux BSP
----------------------------------------

Meta-aa-integration layer requires Auto Yocto BSP release and Adaptive Autosar R20-11.
Steps required for an OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP build are also mandatory.
Sections below expose the additional steps for building Adaptive Autosar
integration.

Adding Adaptive Autosar R20-11 into a Yocto distribution using meta-aa-integration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: an existing Yocto distribution should be available.
 - Get the meta-aa-integration repository and place it under "sources" directory of
Auto Yocto BSP yocto distribution.
 - Add the path to meta-aa-integration layer into 'bblayers.conf' file, manually or
using the following command:  
  $ bitbake-layers add-layer ../sources/meta-aa-integration    
  
 - Get the Adaptive Autosar R20-11 official source code and yocto layers:
   * ara-api : source code for Adaptive Autosar Platform Demonstrator
   * sample-applications : source code for Adaptive Autosar sample applications
   * yocto-layers : meta-ara Adaptive Autosar yocto layer
 - Place them under "sources" directory of Auto Yocto BSP yocto distribution.
 - Add the path to yocto-layers/meta-ara into 'bblayers.conf' file,
manually or using the following command:  
  $ bitbake-layers add-layer ../sources/yocto-layers/meta-ara  

 - Make the following additions:
   * in yocto-layers/meta-ara/conf/layer.conf :

     `- LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_apd = "zeus"` 

     `+ LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_apd = "zeus gatesgarth"`

 NOTE: An Adaptive Autosar license must be obtained in order to download the official Adaptive Autosar R20-11 source code.  

Build Adaptive Autosar Images
-----------------------------

You can build the following Adaptive Autosar images, using:  
$ bitbake <image_name>  
where <image_name> is one of the following:
- core-image-apd-minimal
- core-image-apd-minimal-radar
- core-image-apd-minimal-fusion
- core-image-apd-minimal-radar-fusion
- core-image-apd-ecu1-scenario2
